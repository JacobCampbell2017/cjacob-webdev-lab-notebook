### 01 html

I was able to complete the the exercises on my own without using the solutions. I think these exercises were helpful to give me opportunity to get used to html. I hoped to be able to do something with the information stored in the form.

### 03 css

I used a bit of the solutions for small things I forgot when applying to multiple classes but this exercise was very helpful to be able to get a grip on CSS.

### 04 flexbox

This exercise showed me how awful my CSS was from the previous exercises. These exercises are good to check my understanding. I checked the solution for the first layout of the first problem when I got frustrated but after that I was able to build off it on my own.

### 05 css grid

The same thing with the previous week. I looked at the first solution as a safety check but was able to complete the rest without the solutions.

### 06 bootstrap

My problem was trying to understand how bootstrap was too work. Some part of me was not grasping the information well and I had to just follow the solutions step-by-step for these ones. I think I was struggling to understand bootstrap because it is a widely used term with many different meanings.

### 07 Javascript

I was able to complete these on my own but with help of online resources as well (Just google searches to reaffirm my wonders). The exercises were very helpful to learn javascript and how it interacts with the html. I did look ahead to next week to use js and jquery.

### 08 jquery

I needed help to complete this week. I was pulling steps in the wrong order and it was bugging me. I used the solutions and online resources.
